# Contact Tracing Notification App

This app was created for the epidemiology and public health teams at Cambridge and North Suffolk to notify individuals of their potential exposure to COVID-19. See `#covid-reporting` for the history of the project, and `#twilio-integration` for inbound messages pushed to Slack.

Developed and deployed to Twilio, the app can be found at [contact-tracing.camb-nsphc.mapc.org](http://contact-tracing.camb-nsphc.mapc.org/), which points to [sms-notifications-4070-y9jf5u.twil.io/index.html](https://sms-notifications-4070-y9jf5u.twil.io/index.html). The Application Passcode can be found on Dashlane.  

Access logs and development via [console.twilio.com](console.twilio.com).
